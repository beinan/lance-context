//! Per-table maintenance demand folded from per-shard watermarks.
//!
//! Schema: `docs/design/scheduler-p1-data-model.md` §1. The record stored
//! under `P/demand-events/<hex>/<shard>` is the per-dimension **join** of
//! everything every publisher (writer, executor, scan) has reported for that
//! shard, and `TableDemand::fold` applies the same join in memory. Joins are
//! idempotent and commutative, so any order or duplication of the same
//! events - and a rebuild from the stored records - yields the same answer.
//!
//! Generation numbers are monotonic per shard across writer epochs: Lance
//! keeps `current_generation` and `flushed_generations` when a new writer
//! claims a shard (`ShardManifest { writer_epoch: next, ..base }`). The epoch
//! is therefore a writer fence and a tiebreak, never a numbering restart.
